## Apply filters

As per Energy Star's technical document [ENERGY STAR Score for Warehouses](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/energy-star-score-warehouses), following filters are applied to define the peer group and to remove any outliers.

After applying each filter, the number of remaining buildings in the dataset (_Number Remaining: X_) and any difference (_Difference: X_) in count from the original Energy Star's technical documentation is also given. 

#. **Calculate source energy and source EUI**
    ```{r}
## convert electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat to source energy

  mutate(ELBTU0 = ELBTU*2.80) %>%
  mutate(NGBTU0 = NGBTU*1.05) %>%
  mutate(FKBTU0 = FKBTU*1.01) %>%
  mutate(DHBTU0 = DHBTU*1.20) %>%
  mutate(SOURCE_ENERGY = rowSums(dplyr::select(., c(ELBTU0,NGBTU0,FKBTU0,DHBTU0)), na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(SOURCE_EUI = round(SOURCE_ENERGY/SQFT, 2)) %>%
  mutate(SITE_EUI = round(MFBTU/SQFT, 2)) %>%
  mutate(NGBTU_PERCENT = round(NGBTU / SOURCE_ENERGY * 100, 2)) %>%

#. **A single activity must characterize greater than 50% of the floor space**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – In order to be considered part of the warehouse peer group, more than 50% of the building must be defined as distribution/shipping center, non-refrigerated warehouse, or refrigerated warehouse.
<br/>Number Remaining: 568.
<br/>Difference: +25
    ```{r}

    ```

#. **If propane is used, the maximum estimated propane amount must be 10% or less of the total source energy**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Because propane values are estimated from a range, propane is restricted to 10% of the total source energy.
<br/>Number Remaining: 510.
<br/>Difference: +6.
    ```{r}
    w10 = w9 %>%

```{r}
write.csv(w15, paste0(filtered_dir, building_type, ".csv"), row.names = F)

## Prepare features

The final regression equation includes the following variables: 

 - Weekly Operating Hours
 - Number of Workers per 1,000 Square Feet
 - Percent Cold Storage
 - Heating Degree Days times Percent of the Building that is Heated
 - Cooling Degree Days times (Percent of the Building that is Cooled plus Percent Cold Storage)

```{r}

  mutate(HDD65_HEATP = HDD65 * HEATP / 100) %>%
  mutate(CDD65_COLD_SUM = CDD65 * COLD_SUM / 100) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3)

ivars = c(
  #"RFGSTP", ## too many missing values
