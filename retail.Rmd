## Apply filters

As per Energy Star's technical document [ENERGY STAR Score for Retail Stores and Supermarkets](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/energy-star-score-retail-stores), following filters are applied to define the peer group and to remove any outliers.

After applying each filter, the number of remaining buildings in the dataset (_Number Remaining: X_) and any difference (_Difference: X_) in count from the original Energy Star's technical documentation is also given. 


#. **Calculate source energy and source EUI**
    ```{r}

#. **PBAPLUS= 14 or 42**
<br/>Building Filter – CBECS defines building types according to the variable “PBAPLUS.” Retail Stores are coded as PBAPLUS = 42 and Supermarkets are coded as PBAPLUS = 14.
<br/>Number Remaining: 342.

    ```{r}
    r6 = r5 %>% filter(MONUSE >= 10)
    ```

#. **A single activity must characterize more than 50% of the floor space**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – In order to be considered part of the retail store and supermarket peer group, more than 50% of the building must be defined as a retail store or supermarket.
<br/>If the variable ONEACT=1, this indicates that one activity occupies 75% or more of the building. If the variable ONEACT=2, then the building can specify up to 3 activities (ACT1, ACT2, ACT3). One of these activities must be Food Sales or Service (PBAX=14) or Retail (Other Than Mall) (PBAX=16), with a corresponding percent (ACT1PCT, ACT2PCT, ACT3PCT) that is greater than 50.
<br/>Number Remaining: 306.
<br/>Difference: +5.
    ```{r}
r7 = r6 %>%

#. **If propane is used, the amount category (PRAMTC) must equal 1, 2, or 3**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Cannot estimate propane use if the quantity is “greater than 1000” or unknown.
<br/>Number Remaining: 294.
<br/>Difference: +5.
    ```{r}
    r9 = r8 %>% filter(is.na(PRAMTC) | PRAMTC %in% c(1,2,3))
    ```        

#. **If propane is used, the unit (PRUNIT) must be known**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Cannot estimate propane use if the unit is unknown.
<br/>Number Remaining: 292.
<br/>Difference: +5.
    ```{r}
    r10 = r9 %>% filter(is.na(PRUNIT) | PRUNIT %in% c(1,2))
    ```    

#. **If propane is used, the maximum estimated propane amount must be 10% or less of the total source energy**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Because propane values are estimated from a range, propane is restricted to 10% of the total source energy.
<br/>Number Remaining: 289.
<br/>Difference: +7.
    ```{r}
    r11 = r10 %>% 
      filter( PRUSED == 2 | is.na(NGBTU_PERCENT) == T |

    ```    

#. **must not use chilled water, wood, coal, or solar**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – CBECS does not collect quantities of chilled water, wood, coal, or solar.
<br/>Number Remaining: 282.
<br/>Difference: +8.

    ```


#. **Must have fewer than 0.7 walk-in refrigeration/freezer cases per 1,000 square feet**

## Prepare features

The final regression equation includes the following variables: 

 - Weekly Operating Hours
 - Number of Workers per 1,000 Square Feet
 - Number of Commercial Refrigeration/Freezer Units per 1,000 Square Feet
 - Natural log of Heating Degree Days times Percent of the Building that is Heated
 - Natural log of Cooling Degree Days times Percent of the Building that is Cooled
 - Yes/No variable indicating whether the Building is a Supermarket (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Adjustment for the Number of Workers per 1,000 Square Feet for a Supermarket
