## Apply filters

As per Energy Star's technical document [ENERGY STAR Score for Worship Facilities](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/energy-star-score-worship-facilities), following filters are applied to define the peer group and to remove any outliers.

After applying each filter, the number of remaining buildings in the dataset (_Number Remaining: X_) and any difference (_Difference: X_) in count from the original Energy Star's technical documentation is also given. 

#. **Calculate source energy and source EUI**
    ```{r}
## convert electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat to source energy
w0 = worships %>% 
  mutate(ELBTU0 = ELBTU*2.80) %>%
  mutate(NGBTU0 = NGBTU*1.05) %>%
  mutate(FKBTU0 = FKBTU*1.01) %>%
  mutate(DHBTU0 = DHBTU*1.20) %>%
  mutate(SOURCE_ENERGY = rowSums(dplyr::select(., c(ELBTU0,NGBTU0,FKBTU0,DHBTU0)), na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(SOURCE_EUI = round(SOURCE_ENERGY/SQFT, 2)) %>%
  mutate(SITE_EUI = round(MFBTU/SQFT, 2)) %>%
  mutate(NGBTU_PERCENT = round(NGBTU / SOURCE_ENERGY * 100, 2)) %>% 
  mutate(SUMBTU = rowSums(dplyr::select(., c(ELBTU,NGBTU,FKBTU,DHBTU)), na.rm = T))

#Is MFBTU the sum of ELBTU,NGBTU,FKBTU,DHBTU? YES.
#summary(o14$MFBTU - o14$SUMBTU)

    ```


#. **PBAPLUS = 21**
<br/>Building Type Filter – CBECS defines building types according to the variable “PBAPLUS.” Religious Worship is coded as PBAPBLUS= 21.
<br/>Number Remaining: 352.
<br/>Difference: 0.
    ```{r}
    w1 = w0 %>% filter(PBAPLUS == 21)
    ```


#. **Must operate for at least 30 hours per week**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – Baseline condition for being a full time worship facility.
<br/>Number Remaining: 351.
<br/>Difference: 0.
    ```{r}
    w2 = w1 %>% filter(WKHRS >= 1)
    ```


#. **Must have at least 1 seat**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – Baseline condition for being a full time worship facility.
<br/>Number Remaining: 351.
<br/>Difference: 0.
    ```{r}
    w3 = w2 %>% filter(RWSEAT >= 1)
    ```
    

#. **Must operate for at least 10 months per year**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – Baseline condition for being a full time worship facility.
<br/>Number Remaining: 339.
<br/>Difference: 0.
    ```{r}
    w4 = w3 %>% filter(MONUSE >= 10)
    ```


#. **A single activity must characterize greater than 50% of the floor space**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – In order to be considered part of the worship facility peer group, more than 50% of the building must be defined as religious worship.
<br/>This filter is applied by a set of screens. If the variable ONEACT=1, then one activity occupies 75% or more of the building. If the variable ONEACT=2, then the activities in the building are defined by ACT1, ACT2, and ACT3. One of these activities must be coded as religious worship (PBA=18), with a corresponding percent (ACT1PCT, ACT2PCT, ACT3PCT) that is greater than 50.
<br/>Number Remaining: 329.
<br/>Difference: +2.
    ```{r}
    w5 = w4 %>% 
      filter( (ONEACT == 1) |
            (ONEACT == 2 & 
               ((ACT1 %in% c(18) & ACT1PCT > 50) | 
                  (ACT2 %in% c(18) & ACT2PCT > 50) | 
                  (ACT3 %in% c(18) & ACT3PCT > 50) )))

    ```


#. **Must report energy usage**
<br/>EPA Program Filter – Baseline condition for being a full time worship facility.
<br/>Number Remaining: 329.
<br/>Difference: +2.
    ```{r}
    w6 = w5 %>% filter(!is.na(MFBTU))
    ```


#. **Must be less than or equal to 1,000,000 square feet**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – CBECS masks surveyed properties above 1,000,000 square feet by applying regional averages.
<br/>Number Remaining: 329.
<br/>Difference: +2.
    ```{r}
    w7 = w6 %>% filter(SQFT <= 1000000)
    ```
    

#. **If propane is used, the amount category (PRAMTC) must equal 1, 2, or 3**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Cannot estimate propane use if the quantity is “greater than 1000” or unknown.
<br/>Number Remaining: 314.
<br/>Difference: +2.
    ```{r}
    w8 = w7 %>% filter(is.na(PRAMTC) | PRAMTC %in% c(1,2,3))
    ```


#. **If propane is used, the unit (PRUNIT) must be known**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Cannot estimate propane use if the unit is unknown.
<br/>Number Remaining: 314.
<br/>Difference: +2.
    ```{r}
    w9 = w8 %>% filter(is.na(PRUNIT) | PRUNIT %in% c(1,2))
    ```

#. **If propane is used, the maximum estimated propane amount must be 10% or less of the total source energy**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Because propane values are estimated from a range, propane is restricted to 10% of the total source energy.
<br/>Number Remaining: 314.
<br/>Difference: +22.
    ```{r}
    w10 = w9 %>% 
      filter( PRUSED == 2 | is.na(NGBTU_PERCENT) == T | 
            (PRUSED == 1 & NGBTU_PERCENT <= 10))
    ```

#. **must not use chilled water, wood, coal, or solar**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – CBECS does not collect quantities of chilled water, wood, coal, or solar.
<br/>Number Remaining: 310. 
<br/>Difference: +22.
    ```{r}
    w11 = w10 %>% 
      filter(CWUSED == 2 & WOUSED == 2 & COUSED == 2 & SOUSED == 2)
    ```

#. **If space within the building is used for food preparation, then square footage used for this purpose (FDPREPSFR) must be reported.**
<br/>Data Limitation Filter – Cannot calculate percentage of square footage used for food preparation if square footage value is not reported.
<br/>Number Remaining: 310. 
<br/>Difference: +22.
<br/>**TODO: FDPREPSFR is not available in the dataset**
    ```{r}
    w12 = w11 
    ```


#. **Must have no more than 250 seats per 1,000 square feet**

    w14 = w13 %>% filter(NWKER  / SQFT * 1000 <= 2.5)
    ```

<br/>Analytical Filter – Values determined to be statistical outliers.
<br/>Number Remaining: 279. 
<br/>Difference: +26.
    ```{r}
    w15 = w14 %>% filter(WKHRS != 168)
    ```

## Prepare features

The final regression equation includes the following variables: 

 - Weekly Operating Hours
 - Number of Religious Worship Seats per 1,000 Square Feet
 - Percent of Square Footage Used for Food Preparation
 - Heating Degree Days times Percent of the Building that is Heated
 - Cooling Degree Days times Percent of the Building that is Cooled


```{r}

  mutate(HDD65_HEATP = HDD65 * HEATP / 100) %>%
  mutate(CDD65_COOLP = CDD65 * COOLP / 100) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3)

ivars = c(
  "SQFT",
  "WKHRS", "RWSEAT_SQFT",

dvars  = c("SOURCE_EUI", "SOURCE_ENERGY", "FINALWT")

features = data[, c(ivars, dvars)]
